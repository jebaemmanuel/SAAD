## Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The Client was Driverpass. The wanted us to build a system that students can use to learn how to drive. They already have a brick and mortar system for this and wanted the online system to integrate with their brick and mortar system.
## What did you do particularly well?
I did everything well. Requirements were identified, schedules were laid out and initial system design was completed on schedule.
## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
The System design documents were very simplistic representations. If I had to do it again I would document/analyze the flows again, consider edgecases and less frequent branches and incorporate them in the activity diagrams. 
## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I read the transcript of the interview multiple times to understand what the user wanted before starting system design. In real life I would verify any questions with the client before designing the system. It is important to consider the user's needs early in the design cycle because otherwise the system we build would not be usable by the client and we would not get paid. 
## How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
Software design requires a good understanding of both  product requirements and the capabilities of the system that will be built.
